# A Simple Mapbox App

A simple reactjs app with a map from mapbox.com that allows one to draw a bounding box, a polygon and a circle by picking points from the map and showing the coordinates of the key points: all coordinates for a polygon, centre and radius of circle, and upper left and lower right corners for the bounding box.
